# Pull requests welcome!

I'd love contributions bug fixes, but mainly to add additional graph types.

Please make the pull request against the contrib branch and I will review.

Please watchout for the following before commiting:
* Please keep pull requests for features and bug requests seperate
* Indentation - Please use 4 space indent
* Blank lines - Please check blank lines are... blank :) not invisible characters (spaces and tabs)!
* Please test the new code with Python2 and Python3 - this project should work with both
* Please use ```# #``` To indicate a comment - This helps when un/commenting large code blocks in testing

And most of all, thanks for contributing!!!
